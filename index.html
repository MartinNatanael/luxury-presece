            <p>To reach your potential buyers, you have to know who they are, where they spend their time online, and
                how they make their buying decisions. Agents who use luxury real estate marketing services are able to
                identify your niche market, then create paid ads on Facebook, Google, Instagram, and YouTube that reach
                those interested in your property. These paid ad campaigns are highly customized and targeted, ensuring
                you are not spending money marketing to those who are not in the market for a property such as yours.

        </h2>
        <p data-aos="flip-up" data-aos-easing="linear" data-aos-duration="300">Content is one of the most powerful resources a real estate agent has to promote your property. Being
            able to create high-quality content such as video and copywriting is an essential tool that elevates the
            agents who use luxury real estate marketing services above their competitors. According to a recent
            survey, 85 percent of buyers and sellers want to work with an agent who uses video—and for good reason.
            An agent who uses video is able to connect with potential buyers on a deeper level and build trust and
            rapport. When they use video to market your property, they are showing viewers what it would really be
            like to walk through and live in your home—something that is much more difficult to do with a written
            description.
            However, written descriptions—or copywriting—is also important. Your property needs to be described in
            appealing and vibrant terms on the listing and on any additional marketing that is created to sell it.
            Those agents who work with Luxury Presence get access to experienced real estate copywriters who create
            blogs, website copy, and content marketing pieces that make your property attractive to potential
            buyers.

                Recent research has shown that 44% of buyers found the home they purchased on the internet. Many of them
                simply googled the search terms that they wanted in a new home and started their search that way. For
                your home to show up in these types of searches, your real estate agent needs to use the right terms in
                your online marketing. The effective use of these terms is referred to as search engine optimization or
                SEO. The process of identifying and correctly using the right terms is a bit of a science—one that the
                SEO experts at Luxury Presence have mastered. When a potential buyer searches terms that match your
                home, your property will show up in the results and provide opportunities for the buyer to learn more.

                If your real estate agent is an influencer on social media, he or she has access to thousands of niche
                buyers who are ready to invest in property. To be an influencer, an agent either needs to dedicate a
                large chunk of their time to social media or they need to partner with luxury real estate marketing
                service providers who can put in the work for them. Wouldn’t you rather your agent spent his or her time
                marketing your property and let an expert handle their social media presence? At Luxury Presence, our
                dedicated success team utilizes an agent’s stories and feed posts to help them go viral and become an
                authority in their industry. Once they’ve harnessed the power of becoming an influencer, they can use
                their voice to advocate for your home and sell it more quickly than their competitors.

                Every real estate agent’s success starts with their website. If an agent doesn’t have a responsive,

                want. Their sites are designed to impress with virtual tour integration, HD video capabilities, and lead
                capture strategies that help agents sell your home. Agents are further supported by analytics reporting,
